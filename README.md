# Basic form
 Basic form is a formulary where i show a few things that i can do. It's also the first time i used PDO with OOP, so i'd like to upload here. With all files you can create, update, delete and select an user registered. The input's validation is in Brazilian pattern. Read the README file to know how to use it.
